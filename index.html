      <p>
        A <b>unicorn company</b> is a <b>privately-held startup</b> that has reached a <b>valuation of over $1 billion</b>. The term <b>"unicorn"</b> was coined to highlight the <b>rarity</b> of such companies, as achieving this valuation milestone is considered an <b>extraordinary feat</b>. These companies often operate in <b>high-growth industries</b> like <b>technology</b>, <b>fintech</b>, and <b>healthcare</b>, and they are known for their <b>innovation</b> and <b>rapid market expansion</b>. Unicorns play a significant role in shaping <b>global markets</b> and <b>trends</b>, as their <b>disruptive business models</b> and <b>cutting-edge solutions</b> attract substantial <b>investor interest</b>.      </p>

            <p>The visualization reveals a clear concentration of unicorn companies in specific regions, with the <strong>United States</strong> leading by a significant margin, followed by <strong>China and India</strong>. These countries <b>dominate</b> the <b>global startup ecosystem</b>, reflecting their strong innovation and tech sectors. In contrast, many regions, particularly in <b>Africa and South America</b>, show <b>little to no presence of unicorn companies</b>, highlighting a <b>global disparity in startup growth</b>. This suggests that <b>economic factors, technological infrastructure, and investment opportunities</b> are driving the <b>uneven distribution of high-value startups</b> across the world.

      <div id="line_chart"></div>
      <div class="description-box center-text">
        <p>The line chart shows the number of companies that became unicorns by year instead of their founding year, with a <b>sharp spike</b> in <b>2021</b>, reaching nearly <b>500</b> companies. Prior to this, the growth was relatively <b>steady but low</b>, with <b>gradual increases starting around 2015</b>. The <b>surge in 2021</b> is likely due to the <b>economic and technological shifts</b> brought on by the <b>COVID-19 pandemic</b>, which accelerated <b>digital transformation, e-commerce, and fintech adoption</b>, leading to a surge in startup valuations. After 2021, the number of unicorn companies dropped sharply, possibly due to <b>market corrections and cooling investment trends</b>.</p>

        <p>Based on our observations of the pie chart, it is evident that <b>before 2018, the consumer and retail industry held the largest portion of unicorn companies</b>. However, in <b>2018, there was a significant shift</b>, with <b>enterprise tech taking the lead</b> as the dominant sector. This marks a pivotal change, demonstrating that <b>since 2018, investors and entrepreneurs have increasingly focused on the tech industry</b>. The data further supports this, showing that <b>the tech industry has consistently produced the most unicorn companies each year since 2018</b>.</p>      </div>
